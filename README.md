# tagless-webgl

The code for Luka's talk on tagless final and WebGL.

  I tried experimenting with it, added some features.

The game is hosted at https://lukajcb.github.io/tagless-webgl/ and can be played there.

If you want to compile it yourself, simply run:

```
sbt fastOptJS
```

And open in your browser.
